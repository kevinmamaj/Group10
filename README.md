# Description
The project consists of a web application, which resembles an e-commerce and management system of an electronic business. The web application should be user-friendly, convenient and will contain at least three users, such as the client, economist and administrator. <br/> <br/>
The services the business provides are mainly focused on the sale of electronic means and their successful delivery. In addition to the services mentioned above, the web application will enable users to give their feedback upon different products. Each user will register and login using its credentials, and then will be able to perform different orders, view its historic of purchases and provide feedbacks. On the other hand, the economist will be responsible of the financial states and the company's profits. The administrator can have much more access than a simple user or economist. He can keep track of the purchases made, be aware of the stock of the products, cancel orders and also view specific client data. He is responsible of taking care of different problems or dissatisfaction users might have. <br/> <br/>
The technologies we are going to use, include PHP programming on the back-end and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap on the front-end, and MySql as a database.
