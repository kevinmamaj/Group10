# Description
Our project consists of a webAPI which is like an e-commerce and management system of a real business. 
The business is an electronic shop, which operates in different cities of Albania. The webAPI should be user-friendly and will contain at least three user, such as the client, economist and administrator. 
The program is a composition of the services the bussines provides, such as the supply of the electronic assets, the delivery of the products bought by customers, and financial states monthly and weekly.
Each user will register and login using its credentials, and then will be able to perform different tasks. For example the client will be able to view and buy products. The economist will be responsible of the financial states and the company's bilance. The administrator on the other hand can have more access then the other user and manage all of them.
